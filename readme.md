## High Mountain Asia Daily Discharge (HMADD)

This repository contains the codes used to simulate/analyze daily river discharge in High Mountain Asia (HMA). The approach estimates daily discharge from three major components: remotely sensing of river discharge, runoff modeling, and data assimilation of the remotely sensed discharge within a river routing scheme. We used 4 runoff products from GRFR, WBM, Noah-MP, and NOAA-GFDL models in the river routing. We used Landsat and PlanetScope images to for the remote sensing of river discharge which were assimilated in the river routing framework. 

The HMADD data product will be submitted to NSIDC.

The manuscript is currently in revision at AGU Advances.
